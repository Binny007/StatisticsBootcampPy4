#Multilinear Regression Analysis

--> In this session, we have dive deep into the statistical modeling, by learning how to predict the future outcomes, how to explore data, and how to really leverage information for data-driven decisions. 

--> We start with basiscs of Linear Regression and work our way up to advanced techniques such as Multilinear Regression and Model Evaluation.

--> Also learn how to use Python to create scatter plots, perform Linear Regression, and analyze the output.

--> By the end of this session, you will be able to navigate this technique to apply it in your own job.
